### Course Overview
Welcome to this Python Project!  

This mini-course is intended to be a follow-on to the [Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-science) course for you to demonstrate basic Python skills that you have acquired in that course.

In this mini-course, **`you will be assuming the role of a Cloud Application Developer`**.  In this role, you will be introduced to the **process of packaging and unit testing in Python**.  Packaging allows the Cloud Application Developer to produce a code unit that can be tested and integrated into a code base. Unit testing assures that code is error-free and integrates properly within a larger project.  You will create **functions and unit tests, run the unit tests and package all the files in a standard Python Package**.  You will submit screenshots of your work as you progress for your peers to review and evaluate your work.

*NOTE*: This course is not intended to teach you Python and does not have too much instructional content. It is intended for you to apply prior Python knowledge.
